# Demand-and-Supply-Analysis
## Introduction:

Demand and supply analysis is a key concept in economics that helps to understand how prices are determined in a market economy. By exploring the relationship between the quantity of a good or service demanded by consumers and the quantity supplied by producers, businesses can make informed decisions to maximize profits. In this presentation, we will delve into a data science project using Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze demand and supply in the context of cab rides.

## Objective:

The objective of this project is to analyze the demand and supply of cab rides by examining the dataset provided. By exploring the relationship between the number of drivers active per hour, the number of riders active per hour, and the number of rides completed, we aim to gain insights into market dynamics and price determination in the cab industry.

## Data Description:

Our dataset includes the following variables:

Drivers Active Per Hour: Number of drivers active per hour.
Riders Active Per Hour: Number of riders looking for rides.
Rides Completed: Number of rides completed.
This data will allow us to analyze the demand for cab rides (Riders Active Per Hour) and the supply of cab rides (Drivers Active Per Hour) to determine how it impacts the number of rides completed. By visualizing this data using Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we can gain valuable insights into market behavior and resource allocation in the cab industry.

## Conclusion:

Demand and supply analysis is a crucial tool in understanding market dynamics and making informed business decisions. By analyzing the relationship between the quantity demanded and supplied, businesses can optimize production, pricing, and resource allocation strategies. In this project, we used Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to examine the demand and supply of cab rides based on the dataset provided. Through this analysis, we gained insights into the factors influencing the cab industry, helping businesses to make strategic decisions for maximizing profits.)
